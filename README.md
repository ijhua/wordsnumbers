# Purpose
This app is largely an exercise in creative problem-solving and creating a GUI in Python. 

# Running the game
Right now, of the packaged files, only the unix executable works. I don't want to install Wine yet to get a Windows EXE. 

# Background
This game is inspired on the British gameshow Countdown, which has letter and number games. 

# Future Steps
- Create a game inspired by the numbers round
- Add a timer for each round
- Improve the aesthetics of the GUI
